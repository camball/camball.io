> Checking Types with `is` versus `isinstance()`

```py
>>> class MyError(IndexError):
...     pass
...
>>> e = MyError()
>>> type(e)
<class '__main__.MyError'>
>>> isinstance(e, MyError)
True
>>> isinstance(e, IndexError)
True
>>> type(e) is MyError
True
>>> type(e) is IndexError
False
```

As you can see, `is` only checks whether the *exact* type is the same, whereas `isinstance()` will also check for subclasses of a type.

This isn't a bad thingâ€”just be aware of which you intend to use... and in the vast majority of cases, `isinstance()` is probably the one you intend to use.
